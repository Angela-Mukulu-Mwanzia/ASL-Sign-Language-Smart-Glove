## Objectives
- •	To develop a system which may translate sign language into text and speech with a high level of accuracy for recognizing gestures.
- •	To raise the efficiency of the past gloves by increasing the letters.
- •	To decrease the glove dimensions so that it becomes easier to use effectively.
- •	To translate ASL letters and numbers for it is a prototype with a limited amount of space which will later on be upgraded to store ASL conversational data.

# Challenges faced
I.) Solving errors in code
II) Connecting jump wires on breadboard
III.) Converting text to speech
IV.) Integrating the system to work
V.) Soldering the wires without affecting the resistance of the sensors.
VI.) Calculating the angles was difficult because the resistance is not stable.
